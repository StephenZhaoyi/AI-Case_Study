Title: Service Intervals & Maintenance
Category: After-Sales Service

Our vehicles use a Condition Based Service (CBS) system that monitors key components and calculates individual service intervals based on actual driving conditions.

Standard Service Schedule:
- Engine Oil Service: Every 15,000 km or 12 months (whichever comes first)
- Comprehensive Vehicle Inspection: Every 30,000 km or 24 months
- Brake Fluid: Every 2 years regardless of mileage
- Spark Plugs (gasoline engines): Every 60,000 km
- Air Filter: Every 40,000 km
- Cabin Air Filter: Every 20,000 km or annually

Electric Vehicles:
- Annual vehicle check recommended
- Brake fluid every 2 years
- No engine oil changes required
- Battery health check included in annual inspection
- Service intervals are significantly longer due to fewer moving parts

The CBS system displays remaining service life in the vehicle's infotainment system and the companion mobile app. Customers receive automatic notifications when service is approaching.

Pre-paid maintenance packages are available covering 3, 4, or 5 years.
